<h1>Welcome to Choosel!</h1>
This help provides you with an overview of how to import data, how to configure views, and how to work with selections.

<h1>Importing data</h1>

<p>
Choosel allows you to import data using comma separated value (CSV) files. To import a CSV file:
<ol>
<li>Open a previously created CSV file using a text editor (e.g., Windows Notepad) See <b>Creating CSV files for use by Choosel</b> (below) for help on creating correctly formatted CSV data</li>
<li>Select <b>Import</b> under the <b>Data</b> menu to display the <b>Import CSV</b> dialog.</li>
<li>Enter a name for the data set</li>
<li>Copy the CSV file data in the text editor and paste this data into the Import CSV dialog paste area.</li>
<li>Click Import to complete the import.</li>
<li>A round cornered rectangle icon will be displayed under the Data menu area, which can now be used to populate views with data.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Preparing CSV for use by Choosel</h2>

<p>
Choosel supports four data types within comma separated value (CSV) data. These are:
<ul>
<li>Numeric values</li>
<li>Dates</li>
<li>Locations (latitude/longitude)</li>
<li>Unformatted text data</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The CSV import routine automatically recognizes these data types based on the following rules:
</p>

<p>
Numeric values must be expressed as decimal numbers, containing one or more digits separated by a decimal point. E.g., 1.0, 4.726355.
</p>

<p>
Dates must be expressed in the formats <b>dd/MM/yyyy</b> or <b>yyyy-MM-dd</b> where <b>dd</b> is a two digit day form 1 to 31, <b>MM</b> a two digit month form 1 to 12 and <b>yyyy</b> a 4 digit year. These values must be separated by forward slashes (‘/’) for ‘dd/MM/yyyy’ and by dashes (‘-’) for ‘yyyy-MM-dd’. E.g., 23/09/2010 or 2010-09-23 define a date for the 23rd of September, 2010
</p>

<p>
Locations must be expressed as latitude/longitude pairs using decimal degrees as <b>lat/lon</b>, where <b>lat</b> and <b>lon</b> are both numeric values as described above. E.g., 48.5/110.24 describes a location at 48 degrees 30 minutes 0 seconds North and 110 degrees, 14 minutes, 24 seconds West. To express latitudes south of the equator or longitudes east of the prime meridian, use negative numbers.
</p>

<p>
To convert a latitude or longitude value expressed in degrees, minutes, and seconds to decimal degrees, divide the minutes value by 60 and add this to the degrees value, then divide the seconds value by 3600 and add this value to get the total. E.g., 110 degrees, 14 minutes, and 24 seconds becomes 110 + 14/60 + 24/3600 = 110.24
</p>

<p>
Any values that do not conform to the formatting described for numeric values, dates, or locations are considered to be unformatted text data.
</p>

<h1>Creating Views</h1>

<p>
To create a view:
<ol>
<li>Click on one of the options under the <b>Views</b> menu (e.g., <b>Text</b> or <b>Map</b>).</li>
<li>The associated view window will be displayed in the work area.</li>
<li><b>Drag</b> a previously created data set from the <b>Data menu</b> onto the view.</li>
<li>If feasible, the data will be visualized based on the type of view.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h1>Working with Views</h1>
<p>
Once you have created and populated one or more views with data, you can explore these data by mousing over data, creating <b>Selections</b> (selected sets of data elements) and by configuring the views. Moving the mouse over a data element in any view highlights that data element. If the element is visible in other views, it will also be highlighted in these views. See <b>Working with Selections</b> for more detail on how to create sets of selected data. See <b>Configuring Views</b> for information on how to customize each view. 
</p>


<h1>Configuring Views</h1>

<p>
Each view contains a configuration area that you can select by clicking on the double inverted triangle icon near the top right corner. This opens up a <b>Mappings</b> pane that contains <b>Grouping</b> and <b>Label</b> fields as well as additional view-specific fields as appropriate. 
</p>

<p>
The <b>Grouping</b> field contains column names for all text fields from the data set used in this view. When you select one of these column names for a column in which there are repeated values the view will redisplay with the data elements grouped under each repeated value. For example, in a <b>Bar Chart</b> view that contains a country list with a column for <b>Continent</b>, grouping by continent will aggregate the individual country values and redisplay a bar for each continent. Selecting a grouping in one window will select the individual elements in the group if displayed in another window.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Label</b> field determines what text label is associated with the data displayed. For example, in the <b>Bar Chart</b> view of country data that contains country, capital, and continent, the bars can be labeled with country name, continent name, or capital name.
</p>

<h2>View-specific Fields</h2>

<p>
The <b>Bar Chart</b> view provides configurable <b>Value</b> fields for any numeric values found in the data set. Select the numeric field to display from a dropdown list of fields and specify how the numbers should be processed (as Sum, Count, Average, Minimum, or Maximum). Note that not all processing options are applicable to all data.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Text</b> view displays a tag cloud that can be configured by changing the numeric values that determine font size. Similar to the <b>Value</b> fields in the Bar Chart view, select the numeric field to display from a dropdown list of fields and specify how the numbers should be processed (as Sum, Count, Average, Minimum, or Maximum). Note that not all processing options are applicable to all data.
</p>

<h1>Working with Selections</h1>
<p>
Selections are subsets of data elements created by clicking on data elements within a view. When the first element is selected, a new Selection is automatically created. Clicking on additional elements will add these to the selection. You can rename or remove selections by mousing over the selection. A dialog box will appear with a text field for the name of the selection and a link that allows you to remove the selection from the current view. 
</p>

<p>
Once you have created a selection, you can use this selection in other views by dragging it to another view.
