    /**
     * <p>
     * Updates the {@link ViewContentDisplay}. There is no overlap between the
     * three different {@link VisualItem} sets (added, updated, and removed
     * {@link VisualItem}s). We use a single method to enable the different
     * {@link ViewContentDisplay}s to do a single refresh of the view instead of
     * multiple operations.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The {@link VisualItem}s can be referenced during a session for reference
     * testing. When a {@link VisualItem} is created, it is passed in as part of
     * the added {@link VisualItem}s, when it changes, it is part of the updated
     * {@link VisualItem}s, and when it is removed, it is part of the removed
     * {@link VisualItem}s.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In addition to changing {@link VisualItem}s, the slot mapping of a
     * visualization could have changed in the same instance. This is reflected
     * by the changedSlots parameter.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> The caller should guarantee that all {@link Slot}s can
     * always be resolved on the {@link VisualItem}s in the
     * {@link VisualItemRenderer}. If a {@link VisualItem} cannot resolve all
     * slots any more, it should be removed.
     * </p>
     * 
     * @param addedViewItems
     *            {@link VisualItem}s that have been added to the view. Is never
     *            <code>null</code>, but can be an empty set.
     * @param updatedViewItems
     *            {@link VisualItem}s which have changed (status, data, etc.)
     *            such that their representation needs to be updated. Is never
     *            <code>null</code>, but can be an empty set.
     * @param removedViewItems
     *            {@link VisualItem}s that have been removed from the view. Is
     *            never <code>null</code>, but can be an empty set.
     * @param updatedSlots
     *            {@link Slot}s for which the mappings have changed. Is never
     *            <code>null</code>, but can be an empty set.
