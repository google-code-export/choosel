/**
 * <p>
 * Classes implementing this interface manage sets of resources. They support
 * event notification on changes and are more heavy-weight than plain arrays or
 * sets. For intermediate calculations that do not require events etc, consider
 * using a {@link LightweightList} via {@link CollectionFactory}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPLEMENTATION NOTE</b>: This interface originally extended
 * java.util.Set<Resource>. However, the collection classes in java.util require
 * supporting subclasses of Resource, as well as supporting generic objects in
 * contains and remove. In GWT, this lead to a performance penalty, as
 * instanceof checks and class casting are fairly expensive (at least according
 * to profiling in Chrome 8). Therefore, this interface now provides methods
 * that resemble the Java collections API, but are specific to Resources.
 * </p>
